<h1 align="center">SGPA-REST-API</h1>

## Introduction

This has been specifically built to suppliment the mobile application that I have
developed. Feel free to use this irrespective of the mobile-app, with which you
can integrate into your own applications/projects to get the data. This RestAPI
provides the results for all regulations, and of all types ( regular and
supplementary ).

## Why I built this RestAPI?

One day, I had to calculate the SGPA for each semester at college (manually), so
I had an idea to develop a [Cross Platform App](https://github.com/hemanth-kotagiri/sgpa-calculator).
I verified if there was a public API access from our [University](https://jntuh.ac.in) so that I
can fetch the details of students and their respective results, but, to my
suprise - there is none.

So, I just created my own.

## Notice

This project has been solely developed by me without any external influence by
a person or an organization or university whatsoever, and if in the case of any
upcoming contributions, they are also equally regarded as developers of this
project.

Contributions are always welcome! Feel free to pick up tasks from the project
section and raise a PR.
Please raise an issue regarding the task that you would like to pick up and
link the PRs for the same.
