<h1 align="center">SGPA-REST-API</h1>

## Introduction

This has been specifically built to suppliment the mobile application that I am
developing. Feel free to use this irrespective of the mobile-app, with which
you can integrate into your own applications/projects to get the data. As of
now, this RestAPI provides the regular resluts of all R18 regulation students of the
batch 2018. Soon, I would leverage this to other regulations and supplementary exams as well.

## Why I built this RestAPI?

I had to develop a mobile application to calculate the SGPA for each branch at
college (manually) ,so I verified if there was a public API access from our
[University](https://jntuh.ac.in) if I can fetch the details of students and
their respective results, but, to my suprise - there is none.

So, I just created my own.

## Notice

This project has been solely developed by me without any external influence by
a person or an organization or university whatsoever, and if in the case of any

project.
